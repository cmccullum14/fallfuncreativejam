    <p> The team captains are lined up mid-field. The coin has been flipped. The slight breeze is in the air, and it carries the smell of burgers and wings from the nearby grills.

    It's Fall Football Time.
        <br>
    <br>
    Although not many people will agree that the fall time is the time to be excited about football coming back, this time of year brings a lot of things to be excited about.</p>
   
    
    <h4> Togetherness</h4>
    <p> You may not like football, but you can't deny it, football brings people togther. People come together to cheer or boo teams. The bond you feel every Sunday night, wrapped up in a blanket after eating a large Sunday meal to watch Sunday Night Football games? Who wouldn't want that?</p>
    
    <h4> Rivalries</h4>
    <p> As an avid Chicago Bears fan (Da Bears!), rivalries are always fun to watch. They bring out the best in athletes and they encourage competition. Take the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers for example; you can find me decked out in Bears swag, booing the Cheeseheads.</p>
    
    <h4>Food</h4>
    <p> The best part of the Fall Football Season... the food! How can anyone not be excited about this part? You have tailgates with burgers and dogs. You have wings, you have sliders, pulled pork and brisket. And don't get me started on the sweets. Pound cake, fondues, cookies and more. I'll even be nice and share a quick go-to recipe for some amazing buffalo chicken dip if you want to have some while watching the big games. </p>

<h2> Da Bears</h2>
    <p> With all of this information, you're probably wondering, <i> There are 32 NFL teams, which team should I cheer for?</i> I can tell you straight off the bat, <i><b> AVOID THE GREEN BAY PACKERS AT ALL COST.</b></i> If you haven't learned anything from this webpage, I'm an avid Bears fan. With that... you should follow the <a href="https://www.chicagobears.com/"; style="color:#C83803">Chicago Bears</a> this season! </p>

<h4>Chicago Bears History</h4>
<p> The Chicago Bears were first established on September 20th, 1919. They have won nine NFL Championships, and one Super Bowl. They even have more victories than any other NFL franchise.</p>
<p> The franchise was even founded in Decatur, Illinois. Who wouldn't want to follow the Bears?</p>
<p> They now play at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Bears has a long-standing rivalry with the Green Bay Packers (Boo!). They've gone through a very long reconstruction period. But now, they're better than ever before!</p>

<h4> Why Da Bears</h4>
<p> The Chicago Bears have had numerous famous players. From Walter Payton to Brian Urlacher, we've seen them all. We've watched the Bears grow into a new program. They have some amazing rookies this year, all to make the upcoming season more exciting!</p>
<br> 

<p> I hope this makes you pumped for the football season! Get ready to Bear Down!</p>
